## 🚀 Polygon Buildathon: From Launch to Fundraising

Our project is designed to evolve with Polygon's "Launch to Fundraising" theme.

**Phase 1: Launch (Current Implementation)**
We have built a robust B2B trade finance platform on **Polygon PoS**. It solves critical cash flow problems for merchants using RWA-backed invoice financing and secure escrow payments, demonstrating immediate product-market fit.

**Phase 2: Scale (Our Vision)**
To achieve mass adoption, FinovatePay will evolve into a dedicated L2 for global trade, built using the **Polygon CDK**.

1.  **Dedicated Chain:** As a CDK chain, we can handle millions of invoices, offer gasless transactions for merchants, and build custom compliance modules directly into the chain logic.
2.  **AggLayer Integration:** Our CDK chain will connect to the **AggLayer**, making our platform's assets (like tokenized invoices) composable across the entire Polygon ecosystem.
3.  **Deep Liquidity with Katana:** We will connect our chain to **Katana** via the **WaltBridge**. This allows sellers on our platform to instantly finance their fractionalized RWA invoices by tapping into Katana's deep, productive liquidity pools. This solves the #1 problem for B2B merchants: **access to capital**.
