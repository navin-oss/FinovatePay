# FinovatePay Architecture

## Overview
FinovatePay is a hybrid payment rail for B2B payments that combines off-chain UX with on-chain settlement, escrow, and compliance.

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Frontend**: React application with wallet integration
2. **Backend**: Node.js/Express API server with Socket.IO for real-time updates
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing application data
4. **Blockchain**: Polygon for smart contracts
5. **Storage**: IPFS/S3 for document storage

### Smart Contracts
1. **EscrowContract**: Handles payment escrow and dispute resolution
2. **ComplianceManager**: Manages KYC status and account freezing
3. **FractionToken**: ERC-1155 for tokenizing invoices (optional v2)

### Data Flow
1. Seller creates invoice → stored in DB with hash recorded on-chain
2. Buyer pays invoice → funds locked in escrow contract
3. Both parties confirm → escrow releases funds to seller
4. Dispute raised → multisig/arbitrator resolves with evidence
5. Invoice financing → investors buy fractional tokens representing invoice value

### Security Considerations
- KYC/AML mandatory for all financial operations
- Multisig and timelocks for admin actions
- Sensitive documents stored off-chain, only hashes on-chain
- Regular smart contract audits

### Compliance Features
- Integration with third-party KYC providers
- Wallet address mapping to compliance status
- Admin ability to freeze suspicious accounts
- All actions produce auditable on-chain receipts

### Monetization
- Transaction fees (0.1-0.5%)
- Subscription for marketplaces
- Spread on invoice financing
- Premium compliance services

## Deployment
- Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
- Backend: AWS/Azure/Google Cloud
- Database: Managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
- Blockchain: Polygon Amoy testnet initially, then mainnet
- Storage: IPFS cluster or S3-compatible storage

## Phase 2: Scaling with Polygon CDK

To evolve from "Launch to Fundraising," our long-term architecture will leverage the full Polygon stack for mass adoption.

-   **Polygon CDK:** FinovatePay will be migrated to its own purpose-built L2, created with the Polygon CDK. This provides granular control over gas fees (e.g., enabling gasless transactions for merchants) and allows for chain-level compliance features.
-   **Polygon AggLayer:** Our CDK chain will be connected to the AggLayer, ensuring unified liquidity and composability with other chains in the Polygon ecosystem (including Polygon PoS, zkEVM, and other L1s/L2s).
-   **Katana Liquidity:** We will integrate with Katana via the **WaltBridge**. This allows our RWA-backed invoice financing to tap into Katana's deep DeFi liquidity, providing instant, low-slippage financing for our users.
